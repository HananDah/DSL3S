DSL3S - Domain Specific Language for Spatial Simulation Scenarios
=================================================================

This project resulted from the doctoral studies on Computer Science by Luís 
Moreira de Sousa at the Instituto Superior Técnico. The aim of this project is 
to develop a graphical language capable of describing spatial simulations in 
the context of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). This is achieved through 
the application of a UML profile coupled to a code generation infrastructure. 

For the theoretical details of the project the following article is recommended:

Simulation Scenarios](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10707-015-0233-y).
