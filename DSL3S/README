== Description

This project is part of the doctoral studies on Computer Science by Luís de 
Sousa (student id D44155) at the Instituto Superior Técnico [1]. The aim of 
this project is to develop a graphical language capable of describing spatial 
simulations in the context of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). This is to 
be the achieved by the development and application of a UML profile coupled to 
a code generation infrastructure. For more details on the project the following 
article is recommended:

DSL3S”, CAMUSS - International Symposium on Cellular Automata Modelling for 
Urban and Spatial Systems, Oporto, November 2012.

== Software dependencies

To run this project the following pieces of software are required:

. Eclipse (3.7.1) - the development workbench [2];

. Papyrus (0.8.1) - Eclipse extension for UML modelling [3];

. Acceleo (3.3.0) - Eclipse extension for code generation [4];

The versions referenced are those presently supporting development and should 
be read as indicative. The same development pipeline based on Eclipse 3.6 
should also be functional; the project hasn't been tested on later versions of 
Eclipse but it should likewise functional.

Beyond the development pipeline, the MASON [5] simulation library is necessary 
to run the end code produced by the DSL3S.
